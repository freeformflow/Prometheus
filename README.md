Prometheus
==========

The Free and Open Chemical Physics Suite (Currently Pre-Alpha)

This software is meant to allow the user to build, visualize, run, and then analyze chemistry simulations.  The focus is currently on classical mechanics, but quantum simulations will eventually be included.

The architecture is drawn out PrometheusPlan.png.  The user interacts with  

Prometheus was built using the Qt SDK to take advantage of C++ efficiency and Qt's platform agnostic qualities.  There are two main interface windows.  One is a visualizer window, that performs 3D live renderings using OpenGL.  The other is a window with GUI button elements....   not all of which work at the moment, lol. 

When the program is active, all you have to do is drag a model's coordinate file over the visualizer window to get started. 

Example file included:  ba.bgf
